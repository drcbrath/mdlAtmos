0# mdlAtmos
Atmosphere properties versus altitude written in Matlab. Based on US standard atmosphere, plus capability for custom temperature profile.

This atmosphere model follows the derivation found in the US Standard Atmosphere 1976. It is based on the hydrostatic equation and ideal gas law. 
When combined with empirical values for temperature profile versus altitude 
and a few physical constants, a consistent model is obtained of atmospheric 
properties from below sea level to the top of the given temperature profile. 
The properties represent the average atmosphere conditions; that is, 
averaged day and night throughout the year, throughout all weather 
conditions, around the globe. Yet, the average is biased to the land masses 
of the northern hemisphere at a latitude of 45 degrees north. Physical 
constants and standard temperature profiles are supplied from the US
Standard Atmosphere of 1976. Additionally, the temperature profile can be 
modified by addition of a constant delta deviation, dT, added to the entire
profile; this gives a simple, effective, and commonly used means of 
representing hot or cold days or approximating specific flight conditions.
Furthermore, a completely custom temperature profile may be used.
